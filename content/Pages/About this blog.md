Hello, I'm Mykyta (or Nick), a Ukrainian artist based in UK, London.

At the moment my focus is on film making. I'm working on two shorts and this blog will be a place where I share my process.

# My interests

I have a tendency to wear "too many hats"^[architecture, animation, film, programming, 3d-modelling, music]. But I don't see this as an issue. My interest end up as my strengths, my tools, lenses for sense-making and exploration which aid me in storytelling, design, and communication.

Broadly, I just love people and what they have to say, what they *must* say – true expressions of humanity. My hope is that what I make could in some way share this feeling and my way of appreciating the little mundane things.

Just now, take a moment, be present, look around you.

You will notice all of the stuff strewn about, and all of it is fingerprinted with someone's else's soul, even the things you take for granted.

The words you are reading are projected by pixels (developed by Russell Kirsch), written in a typeface (Helvetica, designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann) and broadcasted via a complicated network in need of constant maintenance (by many n-letter organisations). Even your thoughts operate within a language framework, encoded from the impressions of your distant ancestors. So much of what we interact with is shaped by millions of decisions, thoughts and feelings.

In these decisions reads our collective humanity. Amazing craftsmanship tells a story of passion, the flaws reveal limitations, highlight systemic failures, or at times shortcomings of the individuals responsible. Noticing and appreciating these minutiae is what fuels my faith in humanity despite all of our mis-steps, and reminds me that we can be beautiful creatures when we pursue truth and love. It makes me feel connected, and I hope you can feel this too.
